            <p>Dispatch is a new and interesting game that was developed by AhHoc Studio. Right now, the game consists of 8 different episodes that have been released since October of 2025. In Dispatch you play as Robert Robert Robertson, the heir to a famous hero Mecha-man. With the burden of Mech-Man being too much and extremely taxing on his body, he announces his retirement from being a hero. He then finds himself meeting another hero named "Blonde Blazer" and she convinces him to start working for a superhero dispatch office. Robert (you) will be the one that chooses which heroes will be sent out for specific jobs. This game is very interactive with players being able to make their own decisions and build their own story. It is a comedy game with loveable characters and fun. </p>
